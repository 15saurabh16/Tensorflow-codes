# Tensorflow-codes
This repository contains scripts that can be run to train a simple feedforward neural network to solve a regression problem. This implementation leverages the efficient automatic queue runner based batching functionalities of tensorflow which leads to high computational performance, compared to a feed_dict based implementation which is infeasible and/or very slow for big datasets. 

1) File tf_toy_dataset_syn_temp.py can be used to generate synthetic dataset. 
2) File tf_syn_dnn_train.py loads the data generated by tf_record_generator.py in the form of tensorflow records. 
3) File tf_linear_reg.py is the implementation for zero hidden layer model. 
4) File tf_dnn_test_rsp.py loads the latest saved dnn weight parameters to produce evaluation metrics on test data. (Note: The input filenames of modelfiles and datafiles correspond to the ones that I used in one of my intern project and should be updated accordingly so that they are consistent with the filenames that you used in  tf_toy_dataset_syn_temp.py (while generating the data) and tf_syn_dnn_train.py (while saving the model weights)).
